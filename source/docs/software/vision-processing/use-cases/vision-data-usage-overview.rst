Robot Code Vision Use Cases
===========================

The goal of this section is to introduce concepts and methods of using data you get from your vision solution.

.. note:: All of these articles assume you already have a working vision solution to get data about the target. For more information about getting a working vision solution, look into the previous articles about getting a working vision solutions.

Vision Data
-----------

Since the most common way to get your vision data is through NetworkTables, all of the following articles assume a ``NetworkTable`` object in code named ``camera`` (Java)/``Camera`` (C++).
For more information on using Network Tables take a look at the appropriate section :ref:`here<docs/software/networktables/networktables-intro:What is NetworkTables>`.
